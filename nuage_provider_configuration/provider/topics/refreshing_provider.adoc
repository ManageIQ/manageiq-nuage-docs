=== Refreshing a Nuage Networks provider

The Nuage Networks provider supports targetted refresh of the supported entities when the Events and Alarms feature is enabled. This will update the information for Subnets and Security Groups whenever the entity in the Nuage Networks VSD is changed. 

Manual refresh is also supported, to achieve this, follow these steps:

. Navigate to *Networks > Providers*.

. Select the appropriate Nuage Networks provider.

. Click *Configuration*, then click *Refresh Relationships and Power States*.

. In the popup, click *OK*.
