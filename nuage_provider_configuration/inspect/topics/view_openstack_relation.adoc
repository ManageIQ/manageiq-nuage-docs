=== Viewing the relationship between Nuage Networks VSP subnets and OpenStack subnets

The Nuage Networks provider can also show the relationship between Nuage Networks VSP subnets and OpenStack subnets if the OpenStack environment is using the Nuage Networks VSP plugin.

To view this relationship, open the *Networks > Topology* view. It will show a connection between the Nuage Networks VSP subnet and an OpenStack subnet as seen below.
