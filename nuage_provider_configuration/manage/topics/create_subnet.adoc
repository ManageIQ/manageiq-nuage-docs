=== Creating a Cloud Subnet on a Nuage VSP domain

It is possible to create a new subnet on a Nuage VSP domain using the Nuage Networks Provider. This can be done following these setps:

1. Select the *Network Router* (Nuage VSP domain) to which you want to add a new Cloud Subnet (Nuage VSP subnet).

2. Click the *Edit* button. 

3. Select *Create L3 Cloud Subnet*.

4. Fill in a *Name*, *Address*, *Netmask* and *Gateway*.

5. Click *Add*. 

This will start a task in Red Hat CloudForms that will create a new Cloud Subnet inside the Nuage VSP domain. In the Nuage VSD Architect, you can see that a zone will be created called *CloudForms Subnets* and a new subnet is added in this zone.
