== Using OpenStack to manage Nuage Networks VSP networks from {product-title}

While the Nuage Networks provider currently does not allow the management of Nuage Network VSP resources, the Nuage Networks VSP integration with OpenStack can be leveraged through the OpenStack provider for {product-title}. Using the OpenStack provider for {product-title}, it is possible to manage the networks, security groups, policies, and much more in OpenStack. The Nuage Networks VSP plugin for OpenStack will then manage these resources in the Nuage Networks VSP environment.
